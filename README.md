With rising demands all over the world, Chatbots have gained immense popularity and are widely used to render a pleasant customer experience. We have built a chatbot to help customers streamline their orders based on their choice of ingredients and help provide an efficacious user experience. It rules out tedious steps of flipping through menus and offers a personalized and customized experience. 
What type of pizza should you order if you enjoy basil on your pizza? What are you most likely to relish if you love pineapple?
The bot instantaneously answers these questions are more! It welcomes customers to a pizzeria and recommends them a particular type of pizza they are most likely to devour based on their preferred ingredients and toppings. It can also simply take orders from the user and is a promising expression of efficiency, availability, interactivity and customer loyalty. We made a dataset consisting of a myriad of ingredient choices and corresponding pizza names and built the Pizza Recommender Bot using Python and rivescript. CountVectorizer has been used to transform a given text into a vector on the basis of the frequency of words that occur in the text and cosine similarity is used to measure the text similarity.
